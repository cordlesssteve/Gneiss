# Gneiss - Feature Roadmap

## Core Game (MVP)
**Target**: Complete tactical rock evolution experience
- Basic mineral absorption system (Granite, Limestone, Iron, Quartz, Coal)
- Turn-based tactical combat vs. Gilded Pickaxe Guild
- Metamorphosis skill tree with crystalline lattice visualization
- Hex-grid 2D mountain cross-section map
- Meta-progression with Core Fragments and Heart-Stone Chamber
- Victory conditions: Dormancy (survival), Eruption, Heart of Mountain

## Major Expansions

### Phase 1: Story Campaign Expansion
**"The Network"** - Multi-entity coordination
- **New Mechanics**: Allied rock formations, network communication
- **Map Evolution**: Connected cave systems, multiple defense nodes
- **Story Arc**: Personal survival → local ecosystem protection
- **Enemy Escalation**: Industrial Guild equipment, permanent bases

### Phase 2: Planetary Defense
**"The Deep Threat"** - Core mining prevention
- **New Mechanics**: Core Resonance abilities affecting planetary systems
- **Map Evolution**: Vertical progression through geological layers
- **Story Arc**: Local protection → planetary defense
- **Enemy Escalation**: High-tech corporate mining (plasma drills, gravity manipulators)

### Phase 3: Asymmetric Gameplay
**"Operation Heartstone"** - Miner Campaign
- **Complete perspective flip**: Play as the Gilded Pickaxe Guild
- **Squad-based tactics**: Manage multiple specialist miner units
- **Resource management**: Guild budgets, supply lines, equipment durability
- **Intelligence warfare**: Use knowledge from rock campaign strategically
- **Time pressure**: Corporate deadlines vs. methodical approaches

## Far-Future Concepts

### Cosmic Scale Expansion
**"Stellar Guardian"** - Extreme late-game concept
- Represent asteroids, moons, planets, stars
- Defend against galactic-scale mining operations
- Reality-bending scale progression from mountain → solar system
- **Note**: Highly conceptual, may exceed reasonable scope

### Additional Gameplay Modes
- **Endless Mode**: Procedural miner waves with scaling difficulty
- **Puzzle Mode**: Hand-crafted tactical scenarios
- **Creative Mode**: Sandbox mineral experimentation
- **Speedrun Mode**: Optimized challenge scenarios

## Technical Considerations
- **Engine**: Consider hex-grid optimization for large-scale maps
- **Art Pipeline**: Metamorphic rock texture system for visual evolution
- **Audio**: Geological sound design (rumbles, crystal chimes, mining sounds)
- **Accessibility**: Colorblind-friendly mineral identification systems

## Monetization Considerations (If Commercial)
- **Base Game**: Core rock campaign
- **DLC**: Story expansions (Network, Deep Threat)
- **Major Expansion**: Miner campaign as substantial content addition
- **Cosmetics**: Alternative rock textures, mineral visual effects
