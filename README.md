# Gneiss

A tactical rock evolution game inspired by Into the Breach and Slay the Spire.

## Concept

You are an ancient, evolving rock entity defending your mountain home from the **Gilded Pickaxe Guild**. This turn-based tactical game combines:

- **Strategic positioning** on a hex-grid mountain cross-section
- **Dynamic evolution** by absorbing adjacent minerals
- **Tactical combat** against waves of miners
- **Build-your-own-class** progression system

## Core Mechanics

- **Absorb**: Merge with adjacent rock and mineral deposits
- **Metamorphose**: Spend energy to integrate absorbed materials and unlock abilities
- **Defend**: Use your evolved abilities to survive miner incursions
- **Evolve**: Build unique power combinations based on what you absorb

## Game Features

### Victory Conditions
- **Dormancy**: Outlast the mining expedition
- **Eruption**: Trigger volcanic devastation
- **Heart of Mountain**: Destroy the Guild's base camp

### Mineral Types
- **Foundational**: Granite, Limestone, Sandstone (common materials)
- **Specialist**: Quartz, Iron, Coal (build-defining minerals)
- **Anomalous**: Rare materials with unique properties
